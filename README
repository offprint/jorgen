## Why not just buy a journal?

Jorgen was not created to make buying journals, notebooks, diaries and
the like obsolete - but rather to create an alternative option for
those who want to be able to have full control over the page content
of their journals. There are a few options available which all ready
provide some of this functionality, unfortunately they fall short by
either offering a limited amount of templates to choose from, or only
allowing for the customization of cover and back, and not the actual
page content.

There are customized journals from a variety of companies covering a
range of different themes and topics, however these are few and far
between and can be ridgley stuck to one specific field, or another.

Jorgen is designed to tackle the themes that haven't been created, and
offer a way to create a journals more that is defined by you and
specific to your needs - which is accomplished through a massive
selection of templates that can be arrange, and added whenever and
where ever you want them.

### Handwritten Text Recognition

A major goal of the Jorgen project is to be able to one day scan the
pages of a Jorgen Journal and have it automatically converted to text
using [Handwriting Recognition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handwriting_recognition).

This tool is a work in progress, and is available to
developers in the [offhand](https://github.com/offprint/offhand) repo.
